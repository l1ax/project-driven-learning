# Learning Resources Guide

## Resource Recommendation Principles

When recommending learning resources for each stage:

1. **Prioritize Official Documentation**
   - Framework/library official docs
   - Language specifications
   - API references

2. **Interactive Learning Platforms**
   - Interactive tutorials (e.g., freeCodeCamp, Codecademy)
   - Video tutorials (e.g., YouTube channels, course platforms)
   - Coding challenge sites (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank)

3. **Community Resources**
   - Well-maintained GitHub repositories
   - Dev.to, Medium articles
   - Stack Overflow discussions

4. **Books and Comprehensive Guides**
   - Technical books for deeper understanding
   - Online books (e.g., JavaScript.info, Rust Book)

## Resource Types by Knowledge Depth

### Beginner Level
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Visual explanations and diagrams
- Simple, runnable code examples
- Interactive coding exercises

### Intermediate Level
- Best practices guides
- Design patterns
- Real-world project examples
- Case studies

### Advanced Level
- In-depth technical articles
- Source code analysis
- Performance optimization guides
- Architecture documentation

## Knowledge Validation Methods

### 1. Checkpoint Questions
Ask users targeted questions to verify understanding:
- Conceptual questions (explain in own words)
- Application questions (how would you use X in scenario Y?)
- Comparison questions (what's the difference between X and Y?)

### 2. Quick Exercises
Provide small coding challenges:
- Write a function that...
- Implement a feature that...
- Debug this code snippet...

### 3. Self-Assessment Checklist
Help users evaluate their readiness:
- [ ] Can explain the concept to someone else
- [ ] Can write code using this concept without reference
- [ ] Can identify when to use this approach
- [ ] Can debug common issues related to this concept

### 4. Practical Milestone Check
Before moving to next stage:
- Review what was built in current stage
- Check if it meets acceptance criteria
- Identify any gaps in implementation
- Ensure code quality meets standards
